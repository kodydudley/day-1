<p class="bio">
I grew up in Nampa after moving here in 2000. I went to BSU where I received my degree in Business Administration. I moved to San Diego after graduation to further my career in the business world. Unfortunately plans changed when COVID hit. I have always had an interest in coding and software development so I started looking into a career change. When I stumbled upon Boise CodeWorks, I decided to take the leap and come home. I'm very excited to see how much we can learn and kickstart my new career!
