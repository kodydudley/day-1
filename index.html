<p class="bio">
I grew up in Nampa after moving here in 2000. I went to BSU where I received my degree in Business Administration. I moved to San Diego after graduation to further my career in the business world. Unfortunately plans changed when COVID hit. I have always had an interest in coding and software development so I started looking into a career change. When I stumbled upon CodeWorks Boise, I decided to take the leap and come home. I'm very excited to see how much we can learn and kickstart my new career!

Now onto what I like to do outside of my professional life. If I'm not at school or work, you can find me either on the golf course or watching some kind of sports. My favorite are basketball and football. If you also enjoy sports or play fantasy football, let me know!
